# 🧮 Scientific Calculator – CASIO fx-991ES PLUS 

Welcome to the official repository of Scientific Calculator, a sleek, responsive web-based calculator inspired by the iconic CASIO fx-991ES PLUS. This project showcases advanced mathematical capabilities implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript—all in a pure vanilla tech stack.

--- 

## 📌 Project Overview

This calculator replicates the user experience of a real scientific calculator with a visually accurate interface, functional shift modes, and mathematical operations ranging from basic arithmetic to trigonometric and logarithmic calculations. Whether you're a student or a developer brushing up your math, this tool delivers a familiar and intuitive environment.

## 🧱 Tech Stack
* HTML5 – Semantic markup for structure and accessibility
* CSS3 – Styling, layout, animations, and responsiveness
* JavaScript (ES6+) – Calculator logic, keyboard interaction, and state management
* No Frameworks – Built entirely with vanilla code for full control and performance

## 🖼️ Features

### ✅ Basic Operations
Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, and power.

### 🔁 Shift Mode
Toggles between primary and secondary scientific functions like:

x⁻¹ / x!, √ / x², log / 10ˣ, sin / sin⁻¹, etc.

### 📐 Scientific Functions
Includes:
Trigonometric: sin, cos, tan, with inverses
Logarithmic: log, ln, 10ˣ, eˣ
Square, Cube, Factorial, Root functions

### 📱 Responsive Design
Fully responsive layout that adapts gracefully across mobile, tablet, and desktop.

### 🎛️ ON/OFF State
Mimics calculator OFF mode with an overlay screen and activation on tap.

### ⌨️ Keyboard Support
Supports real-time keyboard input for seamless usage:
0–9, + - * / %, Enter, Backspace, Escape

## 📱 Responsiveness

Device	Layout Behavior
  * Mobile (<640px)	Compact layout with touch-friendly buttons
  * Tablet (641–1024px)	Grid-based structure with scaled elements
  * Desktop (>1024px)	Full-featured UI with realistic layout

---

## 🎨 Design Highlights

  * Inspired by CASIO fx-991ES PLUS styling
  * Dark-themed UI with vivid color accents
  * Rounded keys with animated hover/active effects
  * LCD-style display for authenticity
  * CSS animations (fade-in, scale) for smooth UX

---

## 🧠 Learning Outcomes

This project demonstrates:
  * JavaScript class-based architecture
  * Conditional logic for dual-mode operations (Shift mode)
  * DOM manipulation and event-driven programming
  * Responsive web design using Flexbox and Grid
  * CSS animations and state toggling
  * UX mimicking real hardware interfaces
